        <h1>How I created this project</h1>
        <p>
        The simulation is a model of what would happen if you put dye in water and stirred it around.<br>
        A similar model is also applicable to smoke.<br>
        <br>
        I have seen multiple fluid simulations of navier stokes equations and wanted to make my own<br>
        I have done a couple of projects with webgl and found it a fun challenge<br>
        I really like how the fluid simulations I'd seen looked<br>
        <br>
        Fluid was more complex than many other things I had done, and paired nicely with webgl because webgl can use textures to simulate vector fields split across multiple gpu cores.<br>
        <br>
        The N in the fluid symbolizes how Nueva is flexible, and can adapt to changes<br>
